    <h1>Happy Friendship Day, Layla!</h1>
    <h2>You mean a lot to me ❤️</h2>

    <div class="poem">
<strong>Drawn in Lines and Laughter</strong>
_by the guy who can't sketch but means every word_

You sketched me once—
not just my face,
but the way we once shared a bench
like it was ours by fate, not chance.
You drew my favorite band—
Queen, loud in graphite.
Even slipped in "Somebody to Love"
like you knew the echo it leaves in me.

You, Layla, turned memory
into pencil lines I’d never dare erase.

You get angry fast—
like lightning on a sunny day.
And me?
I say sorry first.
Every time.
Not out of guilt—
but because keeping you
matters more than keeping score.

I'm awkward around you.
Words fall apart.
But behind the overthinking and dumb jokes,
there’s a truth I rarely say:

You mean a lot to me.
More than "just friends."
More than I’ll ever sketch,
but I’ll keep trying—in poems,
until maybe, one day,
I’ll find the right words
to draw you the way you drew me—
beautiful, flawed,
and somehow… home.

    <div class="footer">
      For Layla, from someone who’s glad you sketched your way into his world.
      <div class="heart">
♥
